result file has size bigger than specified (see below).  This can be
used to save a result under the same filename we started with in a
chain of pipes.Verbose mode (show progress).  
Enables printout of running scan lines.If file is less than MinFileSize, it is deleted and not renamed
to the given name.  This will prevent killing the file we started with if
the result is an empty file, or the pipeline did not
complete.The default file threshold size is 14 bytes, which is 1 bigger
than GIF file stamp (6 bytes) plus a GIF file screen descriptor (7
bytes), so a GIF file with only GIF stamp and screen descriptor will
not be renamed.

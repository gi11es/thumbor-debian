Any local colormap in
a GIF file can be modified at a time, or the global screen one. Verbose mode (show progress).  
Enables printout of running scan lines.  Load color map from this file instead of selected color
map.Change color index values.  The change is made to both the
selected color table and the raster bits of the selected image.  A
translation file is a list of pairs of `before' and `after' index
values. At present, the `before' index values must be in ascending
order starting from 0.If no GIF file is given, gifclip will try to read a GIF file
from stdin.The default operation is to dump out the selected color map in text
format.The file to load/dump is simply one color map entry per line.  Each such
entry line has four integers: "ColorIndex Red Green Blue", where color
index is in ascending order starting from 1.

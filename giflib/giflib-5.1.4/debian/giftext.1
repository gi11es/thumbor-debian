from stdin. Verbose mode (show progress).
Enables printout of running scan lines.  Dumps encoded bytes \- the pixels after compressed using LZ
algorithm and chained to form bytes.  This is the form the data is
saved in the GIF file.  Dumps in hex \- 2 digit per byte. Dumps the LZ codes of the image.  Dumps in hex \- 3 digits per
code (as we are limited to 12 bits). Dumps the pixels of the image.  Dumps in hex \- 2 digit per
pixel (<=byte). Dumps raw pixels as one byte per pixel.  This option inhibits
all other options and only the pixels are dumped.  This option may be
used to convert GIF files into raw data.  Note: the color map can be
extracted by gifclrmp utility.  If more than one image is included in
the file, all images will be dumped in order. Print one line of command line help, similar to Usage
above.

Creating source package
=======================

In the upstream supplied source tarball, certain source files are
missing which are present in the upstream subversion repository.

The debian/orig-tar.sh script adds the missing source files and
creates a DFSG compatible source tarball for debian release. Please
use the 'rules/get-orig-source' target to create the tarball for
debian packaging.

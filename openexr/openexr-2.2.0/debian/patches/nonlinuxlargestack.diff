Justification: fails to build from source (but built successfully in the past)

Hi,

most probably due to GCC 4.7, openexr does not compile when large
stacks are disabled, which is done by default on any non-Linux
architecture (see also configure.ac).
The problem can also be seen in a recent rebuild on hurd-i386[1],
or just when trying to compile it on e.g. kfreebsd; for example on
kfreebsd-amd64:

Attached there is a patch that fixes the issue, by including <cstring>
in ImfAutoArray.h only with no large stacks enabled, and making sure
to call memset from the std namespace.
(Note: it seems openexr 1.7.0 will no more memset() the data array
in the "no large stacks" implementation.)

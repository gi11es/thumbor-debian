# thumbor-debian-backports

The name of the repo is misleading now, as it doesn't just include backports. There are:

- Backports from stretch to jessie-backports
- Upstream version updates (python-statsd)
- Brand new packages for sid, which once accepted/uploaded will be moved to stretch and backported to jessie-backports
